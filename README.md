[batch-shell-open](./batch-shell-open) allows to launch the command line where you want to in one click (need to edit the path to get the right place, not interactive). For ease of use, a txt file is present can be modified than renamed into a .bat file afterwards.

[autoit-launcher] uses autoit to open a new desktop and launch applications.
One of the applications is also the command line. The file manager is there too.
